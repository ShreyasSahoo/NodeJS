//JS was made to run in browsers. Every browser has an engine of its own to run js, like chrome has javascript v8 engine.
//A scientist "Ryan Dahl" extracted out this v8 engine , embedded it with c++ so that js can be run outside the browser as well. In this process, javascript lost some of its dom & window features and gained some low level features like file handling.
console.log("Hey there! I am JavaScript");
